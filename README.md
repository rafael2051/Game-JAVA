## GAME Project in JAVA

Hi there! This is a game made by me and my friends in java.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
